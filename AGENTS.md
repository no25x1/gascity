# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**

```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**

- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files
- For controller or session reconciler incidents, use `gc trace` and follow `engdocs/contributors/reconciler-debugging.md` for the artifact collection workflow.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Architecture Best Practices

These apply to all code in this project — frontend and server:

- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** - write the tests first; the implementation
  code isn't done until the tests pass.
- **Consider First Principles** to assess your current architecture against the
  one you'd use if you started over from scratch.
- **Leverage Types** using statically typed languages (TypeScript, Rust, etc) so
  that we can leverage the power of the compiler as guardrails and immediate
  feedback on our code at build-time instead of waiting until run-time.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** – eliminate duplicated logic by extracting
  shared utilities and modules.
- **Separation of Concerns** – each module should handle one distinct
  responsibility.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – every class/module/function/file
  should have exactly one reason to change.
- **Clear Abstractions & Contracts** – expose intent through small, stable
  interfaces and hide implementation details.
- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion** – keep modules self-contained, minimize
  cross-dependencies.
- **Scalability & Statelessness** – design components to scale horizontally and
  prefer stateless services when possible.
- **Observability & Testability** – build in logging, metrics, tracing, and
  ensure components can be unit/integration tested.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Sir)** - keep solutions as simple as possible.
- **YAGNI (You're Not Gonna Need It)** – avoid speculative complexity or
  over-engineering.
- **Don't Swallow Errors** by catching exceptions, silently filling in required
  but missing values, masking deserialization with nulls or empty lists, or
  ignoring timeouts when something hangs. All of those are errors (client-side
  and server-side) and must be tracked in a centralized log so it can be used to
  improve the app over time. Also, inform the user as appropriate so that they
  can take necessary action.
- **No Placeholder Code** - we're building production code here, not toys.
- **No Comments for Removed Functionality** - the source is not the place to
  keep history of what's changed; it's the place to implement the current
  requirements only.
- **Layered Architecture** - organize code into clear tiers where each layer
  depends only on the one(s) below it, keeping logic cleanly separated.
- **Use Non-Nullable Variables** when possible; use nullability only when
  there is NO other possiblity.
- **Use Async Notifications** when possible over inefficient polling.
- **Eliminate Race Conditions** that might cause dropped or corrupted data
- **Write for Maintainability** so that the code is clear and readable and easy
  to maintain by future developers.
- **Arrange Project Idiomatically** for the language and framework being used,
  including recommended lints, static analysis tools, folder structure and
  gitignore entries.
- **Keep Serialization/Deserialization At The Edges** to make full use of
  type-safe objects in the app itself and to centralize error handling for
  type-system translation. Do NOT allow untyped data with known shapes to flow
  through the system and subvert the type system.
- **Prefer Well-Known, High Quality OSS Libraries** instead of hand-rolling your
  own behavior to get more robust, better maintained and better tested results.
