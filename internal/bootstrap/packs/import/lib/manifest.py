"""Read/write the [imports] section of city.toml.

The user-facing manifest of direct imports lives inline in city.toml as:

    [imports.gastown]
    url = "https://github.com/example/gastown"
    version = "^1.2"

    [imports.helper]
    path = "../helper"

This is the v1 schema. In v2, the same syntax moves to pack.toml at the
city root. The package manager owns the [imports] section but does not own
the rest of city.toml — surgical text edits in lib/citytoml.py preserve
the user's other sections, comments, and formatting.

Read here is straight tomllib. Write here delegates to citytoml.update_imports.
